Ello connects brands, agencies and publishers with a global community of 625K creatives from 195 countries by launching brief-driven creative projects using our [Artist Invites](https://ello.co/artist-invites) technology. Projects are vetted, criteria and project duration are set, awards are determined and projects are launched to the Ello artist community. Submissions are solicited and selected in real-time and top-tier creative work is delivered at scale.

Weâ€™re providing new and more meaningful ways to connect with desired audiences. By bringing creative projects and opportunities to Ello and investing in our community, deeper, more lasting brand affinity is cultivated. Reach becomes a byproduct of support.

To learn more about activating our Artist Invites technology and launching a creative brief to the Ello community, contact us at ArtistInvites@ello.co.
