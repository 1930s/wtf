**Ello’s Artist Invite technology connects the Ello artist community with brands, agencies, publishers and fans through real-time creative briefs.** Working in close collaboration with our clients we launch brief-driven, on-demand creative projects that **activate and engage our community of 625K artists in 195 countries**.

Artist Invite participation is simple. Projects are vetted, criteria and project duration are set, awards are determined and projects are launched to our artist community. Submissions are solicited and selected in real-time and top-tier creative work is delivered at scale. Artists submit their work to the Artist Invites they’re interested in. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, panel of judges and are awarded for their creative work per the criteria of the invite.

To **learn more about our Artist Invites technology and launching a creative brief to the Ello community**, contact us at ArtistInvites@ello.co.
