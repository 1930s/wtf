Books matter, and for an artist, being published in a lasting piece of print goes a long way towards advancing a career. Thatâ€™s why we publish *Underscore*, a premium, perfect bound quarterly monograph packaged with an extra-special accompanying artist interview zine.

Each quarter we launch a creative brief using our [Artist Invites](/wtf/artist/artist-invites) technology to select ten artists for publication in *Underscore*. One artist receives their own book, a monograph featuring their work and ideas while nine others are interviewed and published in the accompanying zine. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and their works are published in NFP per the criteria of the invite.
