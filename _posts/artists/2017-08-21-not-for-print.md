*Not for Print* (NFP) is Ello’s artist community-powered print publication. Submission-based and published quarterly, each issue focuses on a relevant artistic theme and is curated to showcase the creative talent on Ello. NFP is about taking Ello’s internet culture to the printed page and giving credit where it’s due.

Each quarter we choose a culturally relevant theme and using our Artist Invites (url) technology publish a creative brief to the community seeking submissions. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and their works are published in NFP per the criteria of the invite. Each edition of NFP is sponsored by a value-aligned, artists-first brand partner.
