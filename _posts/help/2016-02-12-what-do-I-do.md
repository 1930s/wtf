Ello is The Creators Network, made for anyone who respects, enjoys, or participates in the creative process. If you’re passionate about something, you’ll find it on Ello.

How to get started:

**1. Finish your profile.**

Ello is way more interesting when you let people know who you are.

**2. Discover & Follow.**

[Ello Discover](https://ello.co/discover/) and our [Community Directory](https://ello.co/wtf/resources/community-directory/) will connect you with people and things you are passionate about.

Like most social networks, you [Follow](https://ello.co/following) people on Ello. You can also [Star](https://ello.co/starred) to organize them into two groups. Ello doesn’t manipulate what you see: your stream is chronological.

**3. Post, comment, @mention, and Love.**

Share things you’re passionate about. Ello is positive and welcoming: we don’t care if you’re professional or amateur, experienced or experimenting.

If you’re on iOS, please [download the Ello App](http://appstore.com/ello/ello). Android and much more is coming later this year.

Love,
