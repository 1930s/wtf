We are very pleased to announce that Android development has officially started here at Ello. 

Our mobile lead, @sean, started work on the Ello Android app. We're not trying to build anything fancy at first. We will get it in your hands early, and would love your feedback as we go. We will keep you updated and will reach out for Android beta testers as we get closer.

In the meantime Android users can use our soon-to-be-released, new and improved WebApp. This is great news for people on Android during the run up to the Android App release.

Check out the [WebApp.](https://preview.ello.co)

We do have a handful of disclaimers:
Login with your normal Ello username and password. Anything you do while using the preview will also appear on ello.co or iOS.
* Please don't share the preview link while testing.
* Account creation isn't yet working in the preview.
* WTF/Help Links also don't yet work.
* We are actively working on the Web App, so you will find bugs (please report these using the survey below), and there may be short outages.

And please send us your feedback using [this](https://ello.typeform.com/to/M6igwg) survey.
