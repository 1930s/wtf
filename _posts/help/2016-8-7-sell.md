![Sell your work on Ello using the Buy Button]({% asset_path buybutton.gif %})

Sell your work on Ello using the Ello Buy Button. Here’s how it works:

* Upload an image of your product
* Click the $ icon
* Add a link to the product listing in your store 
* Publish

It’s that easy. Anyone browsing Ello will know that when they see the green $ icon, something awesome is for sale. All it takes is a click on the icon, and they’ll be taken to the product listing on the seller’s site.

We’re currently building relationships with a select group of affiliate partners who will enable Ello to earn referral fees when people visit partner sites from Ello and buy things. We’ll keep you updated on this program as it evolves. We look forward to receiving your thoughts and feedback.
