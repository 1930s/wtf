##What is Ello?

Launched in Fall 2014 with the mission to serve creators everywhere, Ello is the only online community designed and built for creators, by creators. A robust and growing community of artists, designers, musicians, skaters, illustrators, photographers, architects, GIF makers - creators, Ello understands that the process, practice, values and passions of the world’s tastemakers can move the world forward in a better direction. 

Ello is available on the web and via the Ello App.
