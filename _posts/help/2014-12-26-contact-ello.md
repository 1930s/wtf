Ello has a zero-tolerance policy for hate, trolling, stalking, spamming, flaming, impersonating others, harming children, or any other behavior designed to hurt another person physically or emotionally.

All users must follow the Ello Rules, and there are consequences for not following the Rules. If you notice abusive behavior, please report it immediately to [reportabuse@ello.co](mailto:reportabuse@ello.co). We will look into it, and take necessary action as soon as possible.
