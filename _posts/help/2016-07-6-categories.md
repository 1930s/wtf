Ello works to support and promote as many great members as possible through our featured members and curated categories. Featured members become part of a human-curated rotation. Generally, we feature members for 8-12 weeks. We rotate featured members and bring on new featured members in an effort to expose and amplify as much of the great work and ideas on Ello as possible.

Your work will not show up in a specific category unless you or your work is featured at that time. If there's a specific category you'd like your work to be in, definitely let us know. Everything is curated in house by our curation team, so we do the best we can given our current resources. Eventually, you will be able to post into a specific category on your own!
