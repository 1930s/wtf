If you’re a creative who’s looking for a new project, or if you’re looking to hire a designer, illustrator, photographer, gif-maker, or other talented creative – we just made it a lot easier for you. The Hire Me Button tells potential clients you’re available for work and gives them an easy way to contact you privately.

Here’s how it works: 
* Go to Settings https://ello.co/settings and scroll down to “Hire Me”
* Toggle the “Hire Me Button” setting from “no” to “yes”
* Check out the “Hire Me” button on your profile beneath your avatar
* Click on the button to send an email to the Ello member you’d like to hire
* Respond to a request if you’re into the opportunity and carry on the conversation privately.

If you have any feedback on this new feature, send us a note at hello@ello.co.
