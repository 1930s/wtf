The Hire Me Button tells potential clients you’re available for work and gives them an easy way to contact you privately. The Collaborate Button enables fellow creators that want to collaborate to email you.

Here’s how it works*: 
* Go to [Settings](https://ello.co/settings) and scroll down to “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“
* Toggle the “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“ setting from “no” to “yes”
* Check out the “Hire Me” or “Collaborate“ button on your profile beneath your avatar
* Click on the button to send an email to the Ello member you’d like to hire or collab with
* Respond to a request if you’re into the opportunity and carry on the conversation privately.

*_Hire Me and Collab is currently available via Web and Android only – coming soon to iOS._

If you have any feedback on this new feature, send us a note at hello@ello.co.
