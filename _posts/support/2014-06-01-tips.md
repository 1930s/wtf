## How do I make a post?
To create a new post, navigate to the upper right-hand corner of the screen and click on the black “Post” button located next to your avatar.

## What is the Editor, how does it work?
The Editor is the grey box that opens from the Post button where you can drag & drop images, paste embeds and enter text and links. Once you’ve uploaded content, select the category you want to post into below the Editor and click “Post”.

You can put just about anything in the Editor. Here are some things you can do:
1. Type, cut, paste & format text.
2. Drag & drop image files, including .JPG, .GIF, animated .GIF, and .PNG files.
3. Select an image from your computer by clicking the upload icon below the Editor.
4. Mention other people on Ello by adding an `@` symbol in front of their username. For example, @todd or @bergerfohr.
5. Create links by highlighting text in the Editor and clicking the link icon.
6. Embed video files by entering a Youtube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, or Ustream URL link directly into the Editor.
7. Embed audio files by entering a Soundcloud, Mixcloud, or Bandcamp URL link directly into the Editor.
8. Use the keyboard shortcut command + enter/return (Mac) or control + enter (Windows) to submit your post.
9. Use the “Sell” option to add shoppable links to posts and enable the “Buy Button”

## Why does the Editor background change color?
The Editor background is GREY by default when you are composing a post. The Editor background is DARK GREY by default when images are being uploaded.

## How do I create a post that contains a mixture of images, text, video, links, etc.?
Each Editor post can be made up of multiple containers. Each container can hold an image, text, video links, and more. Containers can be re-ordered on the fly, which gives you a great deal of control over how your posts look.

To create a new image container from a text container, simply click on the upload image icon at the bottom right corner of the open Editor. To create a new text container from an image container, just start typing in the blank container at the bottom of the Editor.

## How can I rearrange the order of images, text, and other stuff I put in the Editor?
Click and drag the arrow icon in the corner of each container in the Editor to move it up and down, until it snaps to the desired position within your post.

## How can I format text and add links to my posts in the Editor?
The simplest way is to highlight the portion of text that you want to format. A small edit menu pops up that allows you to add a link, or change the style of your text to bold or italic.

To use an emoji in your post, begin by typing a colon : in your post or comment. A pop-up menu will appear offering you a choice of Emojis! [Read more here.](https://ello.co/wtf/support/text-and-emojis/)
