Ello’s Hire Me Button tells potential clients you’re available for work and provides an easy way to contact you privately. Similarly, our Collaborate Button enables fellow Ello creators interested in collaborating with you, a simple way to contact you in private.

To enable our Hire Me & Collaborate Buttons:

* Visit <a href="https://ello.co/settings">Settings</a> and scroll down to “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“
* Toggle the “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“ setting from “no” to “yes”
* Check out the “Hire Me” or “Collaborate“ button on your profile
* Use the button to send an email to the Ello member you’d like to hire or collab with
* Respond to a request if you’re into the opportunity and carry on the conversation privately
