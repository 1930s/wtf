Rooted in brand collaboration, our ***Artist Invites*** program is and is based on a new model we call, “Brand as Patron,” enabling brands to engage our global artist community to create work in real-time, at scale.  Artist  Invites are creative brief driven calls for entry. They’re project or activation based and provide our artist community members opportunities to collaborate with brands to gain worldwide recognition, grow their creative influence and advance their professional careers.
