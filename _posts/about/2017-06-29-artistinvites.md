Rooted in brand collaboration, our ***[Artist Invites](https://ello.co/discover/artist-invites)*** program is based on a new model we call, “Brand as Patron,” enabling brands to activate our global artist community to create work in real-time, at scale.  

Artist Invites are project based, creative-brief driven calls for entry. They provide our community members opportunities to collaborate with brands, gain worldwide recognition, grow their creative influence and advance their professional careers. Collaborator brands are provided the opportunity to connect with, engage and a support a community of artists at the edge of what’s next.
