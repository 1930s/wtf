*Not for Print* (NFP) is Ello’s artist ommunity powered print publication. Submission-based and published quarterly, each issue focuses on a relevant artistic theme and is curated to showcase the creative talent on Ello. NFP is about taking Ello’s internet culture to the printed page and giving credit where it’s due.

*Not for Print* is a cornerstone of the [Ello Artist Invites](https://ello.co/discover/artist-invites) program and central to our mission to put Creators First by connecting artists with brands and their fans. Issues are sponsored by arts-aligned [partners](https://ello.co/wtf/about/brands/) that value creativity and wish to engage and support Ello’s artist community members in meaningful, valuable ways.
