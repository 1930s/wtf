**The Creators Network**
Ello is the only network designed for creators, by creators. A robust and growing community of artists, designers, musicians, illustrators, photographers, architects, GIF makers - creators, who understand that our process, practice, values and passions can push the world forward in a better direction. 


Unlike the status quo advertising platforms that masquerade as social networks, Ello is not in business to harvest as much of your personal data and sell you as many ads as possible.  As a [Public Benefit Corporation](https://ello.co/wtf/about/pbc/), Ello has a legal mandate to never sell ads or personal data to third parties. 

We believe your content and following are yours. We wonâ€™t throttle your stream or nickel and dime you to reach your following.

**Supporting creators since 2014**
Welcome to the future and experience the promise of the Internet! Ello is building a sustainable business model that focuses first on how we support the creators in our community, amplify their work and put money in their pockets.
