**Ello is the Creators Network**
Ello is designed by creators, for creators. We are a robust and growing community of artists, designers, illustrators, photographers, architects, GIF makers - creators. We understand that our process, practice, values and passions can move the world forward in a better direction.

**You are the producer - Not the product.**
Unlike the status quo advertising platforms that masquerade as social networks, Ello is not in business to harvest as much of your personal data and sell you as many ads as possible. 

As a [Public Benefit Corporation](https://ello.co/wtf/about/pbc/), Ello has a legal mandate to never sell ads or personal data to third parties. All streams are chronological. There are no boosted posts, and no manipulative algorithms.

We believe your content and following are yours. We wonâ€™t throttle your stream or nickel and dime you to reach your following.

**Supporting creators since 2014**
Welcome to the future and realize the promise of the Internet! Ello is building a sustainable business model that focuses first on how we support the creators, amplify their work and put money in their pockets. Our revenue opportunities will be revenue opportunities for the creators fueling the Ello community.
