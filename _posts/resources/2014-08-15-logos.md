Here are some Ello logos that you can use on your web site to help get the word out about Ello. You can also make your own Ello Button [here](https://ello.co/wtf/resources/ello-button/).

Our logo was designed by @bergerfohr, and is a trademark of Ello, Inc. There are some rules that we ask you follow when using our logo:

1. Do not alter the Ello Logo.

2. The Ello Logo is always a black circle with a white smile, unless it is a special version created by us (see the special Ello Pride logo below).

3. Do not use the Ello Logo in a confusing way, including suggesting that Ello sponsors or endorses something, or in a way that confuses Ello with another brand or web site.

Ello was built with love. Please use the Ello Logo with kindness & consideration.
