Many Ello members have created communities as a way to share and discuss specific interests.

You can join any community simply by following them as you would any other account.

Communities can also be found in the Community Category, [here](https://ello.co/discover/communities).

Email [hello@ello.co](mailto:hello@ello.co) if you’d like to start a new community, and scroll to the bottom of this page for more information.

## Here’s a quick guide to help you create and maintain your own community!

Community accounts are just like any other Ello account. To create one of your own, simply log out from your personal account, make a new account from the Ello home page using an appropriate name for your community, and begin posting! Please note that you will have to use a different email address for each account. 

Over months of watching communities grow, we’ve learned some practices that can help make your Ello community thrive:

* **Post regularly to keep your followers engaged and excited.** Communities work best when their moderators post at least once every three days, but not more than five posts per day. If you submit your posts all at once every day they may stop following you. We recommend no more than a few posts per hour.

* **Don’t mass-follow people or mention unrelated users in your posts as a way to gain follow-backs.** This can appear spammy and usually backfires.

* **You will get submissions from the people who are following your community**. It’s awesome when this happens. Do your best to repost only the highest-quality submissions you receive! It really is OK not to repost everything that people submit to you — always write a friendly comment or “love” their submission as a way to thank them for sending something in, even if you aren’t going to use their post.

* **Use large, high-quality images whenever possible.** Images that are 1000 pixels wide or larger look best on Ello.

* **Add personality to your posts.** Keep things alive by adding comments when you repost someone else’s post.

* **Format your posts.** You can use bold, italics, and hyperlinks in your text. Keep longer text blocks short and readable by breaking them up with regular line breaks.

* **Most of all, have fun!**

## What’s an “Ello Featured Community”?

**Exceptional communities that build a substantial following may become an “Ello Featured Community”.**

Ello Featured Communities may show up on the Ello homepage, be recommended when people create new accounts, added to the Community Directory, or listed in the "Communities" Category. 

These communities usually:

* Have at least 50 followers
* Have at least 15 high-quality posts
* Use large, high-resolution photos
* Format text for visual appeal
* Post inspiring and relevant topics
* Have a clear, explanatory bio
* Are public accounts \*
* Post regularly but not excessively \*\*

If you’d like your community to be considered as an Ello Featured Community, please e-mail the Ello Community Support Team at hello@ello.co, and we’ll get back to you. 

\* *(If your community account is set to private, it will not show up in the Community Directory. If your personal account is set to private, it will not show up as the lead next to your community.)*
\*\* *(If you decide you no longer have time to lead your community, please let us know. If a community is inactive for more than 2 months, it will no longer be featured.)*
